    <p><b>About me</b><br>
        I’m Felix a first-year student at KCA university pursuing
        a degree in business<br> information technology faculty of 
        information technology and management <br> 
    I’m a fun of technology 
     as a result of this, <br>I
  become so curious to learn what is all about this technology.  
     <br>
     I’m fluent in English and I can work with maximum pleasure.<br>
      One of my favorite quote <i><b>“Obstacles don’t have to stop you. 
      If you run into a wall, don’t turn around give up.<br> Figure out
      how to climb it, go through it, or work around it”</b></i>.<br><br>
